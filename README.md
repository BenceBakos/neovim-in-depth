## Contribution
In neovim documentations and guides, there is a gap between the beginner level tutorials, and very advanced documentations. This repository exists to fill that huge gap, and make neovim more accessible for the average comfy-IDE users. Much of these guides I wrote are biased in some way, feel free to extend them with your opinion, thus we provide a more colorful picture of the vi world.
Any other related content is welcome as well, including the coming soon documents(Currently `dap.md`, `lsp.md`, `filemanager.md`).
